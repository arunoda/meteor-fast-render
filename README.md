# Fast Render

Fast Render can improve the initial load time of your app, giving you 2-10 times faster initial page loads. It provides the same effect as Server Side Rendering (SSR), but still sends data over the wire to avoid breaking one of Meteorâ€™s core principles.

## Demo

Let's look at a demo. Here is the leaderboard example from [BulletProof Meteor](https://bulletproofmeteor.com). It's written using Meteor and Iron Router:

![a Meteor app Without Fast Render](https://cldup.com/v4PmJqPtlY.png)

Here you see the loading screen while we wait on data to render the acutual leaderboard.

---

Now let's see how the leaderboard loads when using use Fast Render: [click here](https://bulletproofmeteor.com/leaderboard).

You never see the loading screen becuase we don't have to wait on data. Right after the page is loaded, the leaderboard is there. To do this, all we've done is add Fast Render to the app and insert a single line of configuration.

## Usage

> **Attention**
> If you are new to Fast Render, I highly recommend you follow [this BulletProof Meteor lesson](https://bulletproofmeteor.com/basics/no-more-loading). It explains how to use Fast Render and why you might want to.

Add Fast Render to your Meteor app:

~~~shell
meteor add meteorhacks:fast-render@2.0.0-rc8
~~~

## Using Fast Render With Iron Router

Fast Render is compatible with both versions 0.9 and 1.0 of Iron Router. However, you'll need to follow a few rules.

#### 1. Place your routes in a place which can be seen by both server and client.

Fast Render needs to read some of your routes' functions like `waitOn()` on the server. Put your app's routes (`router.js` file or relavant files) in a place which can seen by both the server and the client.

> Meteor's `lib` directory is a best place to keep your routes.

#### 2. Add the `fastRender: true` option.

You need to specify which routes you'd like to apply Fast Render to. That's done by adding the `fastRender: true` option to a route as shown below:

~~~js
this.route('leaderboard', {
  path: '/leaderboard/:date?',
  waitOn: function(){
    return Meteor.subscribe('leaderboard'); 
  },
  fastRender: true
});
~~~

#### 3. waitOn and subscription methods

Fast render runs your waitOn and [controller subscription](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router/blob/devel/Guide.md#the-subscriptions-option) methods on the server. Make sure you're using `Meteor.subscribe` and not `this.subscribe`.

> SubsManager is compatible with Fast Render, so you can also use [SubsManager](https://github.com/meteorhacks/subs-manager) inside these methods.

Since these methods run on the server, you can't have any client related code inside these functions. For example, if you are using `Session` related logic inside a waitOn, you need to make sure that code will only be executed on the client. Here's how:

~~~js
waitOn: function() {
  var date = new Date();
  if(Meteor.isClient) {
    date = Session.get('selectedDate');
  }

  return Meteor.subscribe('leaderboard', date);
}
~~~

#### 4. Global Configurations

If you declare waitOn methods at the global level as shown below, then by default Fast Render will pick data for subscriptions defined inside those waitOn methods.

~~~js
Router.configure({
  waitOn: function() {
    return [
      Meteor.subscribe('courses')
    ]
  }
});
~~~

## Using Fast Render Without Iron Router

If you're doing some custom subscription handling, Fast Render won't be able to identify those subscriptions. This is also true when you are not using Iron Router.

If you want to use Fast Render in these cases, you'll need to map subscriptions manually to routes. It can be done using the following API's:

> The following APIs are available on the server only.

#### FastRender.route(callback)

This declares server side routes using a URL pattern similar to Iron Router's. The callback runs in a context very similar to Meteor and you can use any Meteor APIs inside it (it runs on a Fiber).  Inside, you can subscribe to publications using `this.subscribe`.

Use it like this:

~~~js
FastRender.route('/leaderboard/:date', function(params) {
  this.subscribe('leaderboard', params.date);
})
~~~

#### FastRender.onAllRoutes(callback)

This is very similar to `FastRender.route`, but lets you register a callback which will run on all routes. 

Use it like this:

~~~js
FastRender.onAllRoutes(function(path) {
  this.subscribe('currentUser');
})
~~~

### How Fast Render Works

Fast render runs the `waitOn` function (or one of the Fast Render API calls) on the server and gets the subscription data relavant to the page you are loading. Then it sends that data along with the initial HTML of the Meteor app as shown below:

![Meteor Subscription Data with Initial HTML](https://cldup.com/RFgMhjv7qR.png)

Then Fast Render parses and loads that data into Meteor collections. This makes your Meteor app code (Iron Router) think the data connection has been made, and it renders the page right away.

## Security

Fast Render has the ability to get data related to a user by detecting `loggedIn` status. It does this by sending the same loginToken used by the DDP connection using cookies.

This is not inherently bad, but this might potentially cause some security issues. Those issues are described below along with possible countermeasures. Fortunately, Fast Render has features to prevent some of them.

> These issues were raised by [Emily Stark](https://twitter.com/estark37) from the [meteor-core team](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/meteor-talk/1Fg4rNk9JZM/ELX3672QsrEJ).

#### Side Effects

It is possible to send custom HTTP requests to routes handled by Fast Render either using an XHR request or a direct HTTP request.

So if you are doing some DB write operations or saving something to the filesystem, the code sent will be executed. this could be bad if the HTTP request is an XHR request called by a maligned user. They wouldn't be able read anything, but they could cause side effects.

It is wise to avoid side effects from following places:

* publications
* fastRender routes 
* IronRouter waitOn and subscriptions methods

#### CORS Headers

If your app adds [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) headers via connect handlers, there is a potential security issue.

Fast Render detects CORS headers with conflicting routes and turns off fast rendering for those routes.

It's okay to add CORS headers to custom server side routes, but if they conflict with the client side routes (which are handled by Fast Render), then there will be a security issue. It would allow malicious XHR requests from other domains to access loggedIn user's subscription data.

#### Shared Domains

If your app is available under a shared domain like `*.meteor.com` or `*.herokuapp.com`, then you are exposed to a serious [security issue](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/Zhy1c6MdOH8). In these situations, don't use Fast Render.

If you host your app under `*.meteor.com` etc. but use a separate domain, then your app will not be vulnerable in this way.

## Debugging

Sometimes, you need to test whether Fast Render is working or not. You can do this using the built-in debugger. The debugger works on the client and is safe to run it on a deployed app. It has a few useful features:

#### Block DDP

You can block the DDP connection and check whether the page was fast rendered or not. Once blocked, no DDP messages will be accepted. To block, apply following command in the browser console:

~~~
FastRender.debugger.blockDDP()
~~~

You can unblock it with:

~~~
FastRender.debugger.unblockDDP()
~~~

#### Get Payload

With the following command you can inspect the data that comes on a Fast Render page load:

~~~
FastRender.debugger.getPayload()
~~~

It will be in this format:

~~~js
{
  // subscriptions processed
  subscriptions: {
    courses: true,
    leaderBoard: true
  },

  // data grouped by collection name
  data: {
    courses: [
      [...],
    ],
    users: [
      [...]
    ]
  }
}
~~~

> You can also apply `FastRender.debugger.getPayloadJSON()` to get the logs as a JSON string.

#### Disable Fast Render

Using `FastRender.debugger.disableFR()` to disable Fast Render.

Use `FastRender.debugger.enableFR()` to re-enable it.

#### Logs

Fast Render has robust logging. 

You can turn it on using `FastRender.debugger.showLogs()`.

Hide them again using `FastRender.debugger.hideLogs()`.

You can get all of the log messages by using `FastRender.debugger.getLogs()` and `FastRender.debugger.getLogsJSON()`.
